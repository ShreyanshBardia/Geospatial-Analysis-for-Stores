# Geospatial-Analysis-for-Stores

A restaurant right at the front of the building has maximum visibility and generates the highest footfalls compared to the other areas. Customers usually choose the restaurant that is right in front of them. If your restaurant is not readily visible or requires customers to take a detour, chances are the customer would not go to your restaurant at all.

This is the reason for a quick service restaurant to be profitable, it has to be available at all areas and to stand in competition among its competitors it has to take in account the location of stores of competitors as well. 

To decide the location of a new store geo spatial analysis can be one of the first steps look out for a potential location. Established brands can look for potential location to increase their hold over the market, similarly a new startup can look out for a new place which might not have been tried out by its competitors yet.
Geo -spatial analysis can also be used to close stores(merge) of same company which are in near proximity to each other.

In this project I have chosen Mumbai as the city to do the analysis. I have taken 3 brands into account Starbucks, McDonalds and Dominos. I began with looking for dataset of addresses of the stores but since there was no open source dataset available I scraped data myself from their respective website.
